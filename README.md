# Movies-SQL
#### This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a movie dataset using SQL queries to uncover trends and insights. It explores directors with the most movies, average movie duration by genre, top-rated movies and genres, yearly movie releases, and longest movies. The analysis also includes identifying high-rated short films, popular genres, critically acclaimed directors, and performance metrics for movies with specific keywords like "Love" or "War" in their titles. Additionally, the project examines trends over time, such as recent releases and seasonal patterns in movie ratings and durations.
